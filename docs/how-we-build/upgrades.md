# Atlas Upgrades and Downstream Fix Propagation

> **How Atlas delivers platform improvements to forked consumers without overwriting product work.**

This document defines the v0.1 upgrade contract. It builds directly on
[architecture ownership](architecture-ownership.md) and
[ADR-0009 starter/reference template sync](../adr/0009-starter-reference-template-sync.md).
Executable migration commands belong to [`atlas upgrade`](cli.md) and
[ADR-0010](../adr/0010-atlas-upgrades-downstream-propagation.md).

See also: [releases and governance](releases-and-governance.md),
[Atlas project contract](atlas-contract.md), [Atlas Doctor](doctor.md), [Agent workflow](agents.md),
[ADR-0010](../adr/0010-atlas-upgrades-downstream-propagation.md).

## Mental model

```text
Atlas gives you source
      ↓
you own the product
      ↓
Atlas records enough about the baseline (platform.baseline)
      ↓
future Atlas releases propose safe changes per ownership channel
      ↓
your changes always win unless you explicitly merge Atlas changes
```

Atlas optimizes for **predictability and preservation**, not zero human involvement.

## Ownership / update matrix

Paths use the starter application (`apps/web`) unless noted. “Consumer customization” describes
typical fork behavior — not requirements.

## Lifecycle contract

### At bootstrap (`atlas init`)

| Question                       | Answer (v0.1)                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What version is recorded?      | Root `@atlas/monorepo` SemVer → `platform.baseline.atlasVersion`                                                     |
| Where stored?                  | `atlas.config.json` → `platform.baseline`                                                                            |
| CLI vs template vs contract?   | **Atlas release** is primary; contract `schemaVersion` and manifest `schemaVersion` recorded separately              |
| Enough metadata?               | Yes — version triple + per-synced-path checksums                                                                     |
| Strict when manifest present?  | Yes — missing synced paths or invalid manifest/version setup fail init rather than omitting baseline                 |
| Atlas-managed after bootstrap? | Manifest `syncedPaths`, `repositorySyncedPaths` (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`), generated paths, workspace packages |
| Immediately consumer-owned?    | Product features, routes, shell, env, customized Docker, independent paths                                           |

### During normal development

| Question                                  | Answer                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can consumers edit synced template files? | **Yes** — source-owned platform                                             |
| Effect on upgrades?                       | Checksum diverges from baseline → future replace becomes **merge-required** |
| Ownership transition?                     | **No silent transition** — manifest classifies; checksums detect edits      |
| Three-way merge?                          | Manual until `atlas upgrade` provides release snapshots                     |
| Silent overwrites?                        | **Forbidden** for synced paths when checksum differs                        |

### During upgrade (by channel)

| Channel                                   | Operation                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Versioned package                         | Bump workspace/package versions; read changelog                              |
| Generated artifact                        | Update spec if needed → `pnpm api:gen` → `pnpm api:check`                    |
| Unchanged synced file (checksum match)    | Replace from target Atlas snapshot                                           |
| Consumer-modified synced file             | **Conflict** — manual merge                                                  |
| Unchanged repository-level template       | Replace from target Atlas snapshot when checksum evidence matches            |
| Consumer-customized repository-level file | **Never overwrite** — manual review; remainder of a safe upgrade may proceed |
| Independent / consumer-owned              | Never overwrite; optional review notes                                       |
| Structural convention                     | Doctor + migration docs                                                      |
| Breaking architecture                     | Migration guide + `atlas upgrade` codemod                                    |
| Documentation only                        | Read `docs/migrations/` + changelog                                          |

Optional consumer tooling (Storybook, visual tests, performance CI, security workflows, Dependabot,
coverage floors, Git hooks, Cursor adapters, Docker Compose) is **not** applied by `atlas upgrade`,
including a same-version upgrade. Root `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` are repository-level Atlas
template surfaces, not opt-in enablement. Published Atlas 1.1.0 does not contain `atlas enable`.
After a CLI release that includes `enable` is published, adopt those capabilities with that CLI —
which may differ from the recorded platform baseline — using `atlas enable <id> --dry-run` then
`atlas enable <id>`. See [consumer-tooling.md](consumer-tooling.md).

## Baseline / version strategy

```text
consumer current baseline (platform.baseline + manifest policy)
+
target Atlas release (snapshot / tag / merged main)
=
upgrade plan (patch-safe | merge-required | migration-required | manual)
```

**Determine consumer baseline:**

1. Read `platform.baseline.atlasVersion`
2. Load `syncedPathChecksums` for modification detection
3. Consult manifest for independent/generated/reference classifications

**Determine required work:**

1. Diff target Atlas synced paths against baseline-era content (planner; `atlas upgrade` automates)
2. Classify each item using checksum + ownership channel
3. Validate with `atlas doctor`, `pnpm api:check`, `pnpm template:check`, tests, build

---

## Conflict policy

1. **Record** checksums at bootstrap / post-upgrade (`atlas upgrade`). Capture must be **strict** —
   missing manifest synced paths fail baseline recording rather than producing incomplete evidence.
2. **Before any synced-path write**, compare consumer checksum to baseline checksum.
3. **Equal** (proven unchanged) → consumer has not edited since baseline → safe replace allowed.
4. **Unequal** (proven modified) → `merge-required` → emit deterministic conflict; do not write.
5. **Missing/invalid baseline checksum or missing consumer file** → `unknown` evidence → manual
   review; do not write.
6. **Independent paths** → never auto-written regardless of checksum.
7. **Product paths** → out of scope for template upgrade planner.

Internal planner: `packages/cli/src/upgrade/plan.ts` (test-only in v0.1). Security-relevant path
detection in the planner is a **rehearsal heuristic**; canonical security classification belongs to
advisory metadata. `atlas upgrade` must not treat the heuristic as policy.

---

## Security propagation

Aligns with [security engineering](security.md) (advisories). The upgrade contract defines local
contracts only.

| Step                      | Behavior                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affected versions         | Future advisories map to Atlas SemVer ranges                        |
| Detection                 | Compare `platform.baseline.atlasVersion`; Doctor baseline warnings  |
| Package fixes             | Bump `@atlas/*` workspace versions                                  |
| Template fixes            | Patch-safe replace on untouched synced security paths               |
| Customized security files | `merge-required` + security-critical — operator must merge urgently |
| Urgency                   | Security fixes may ship outside normal deprecation windows          |
| Advisory backend          | **Not in the upgrade contract** — see [security.md](security.md)    |

---

## Downstream → upstream

| Step             | Action                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Classify      | Use ownership matrix — is the bug in package, synced template, generator, or docs? |
| 2. Reproduce     | Minimal repro in `apps/web` and/or `apps/reference`                                |
| 3. Fix canonical | Apply fix to package or starter synced path — not client fork                      |
| 4. Test          | Regression in owning package/app/CLI tests                                         |
| 5. Release       | New Atlas snapshot + changelog/migration notes                                     |
| 6. Propagate     | Consumers upgrade via this contract                                                |

Use the [downstream fix intake template](../governance/downstream-fix-intake.md) when filing
upstream work from a consumer discovery.

Cherry-picking client commits is **not** the supported model.

## Upgrade rehearsal

### Synthetic fixture

Fixture: `packages/cli/src/__tests__/fixtures/upgrade-rehearsal/`

Test suite: `packages/cli/src/__tests__/upgrade-rehearsal.test.ts`

Simulated consumer at Atlas `0.1.0`:

- Unchanged `lib/api/errors.ts` → receives `0.2.0` fix automatically (test apply helper)
- Customized `lib/auth/session.ts` → conflict; consumer content preserved
- Generated `schema.ts` → regenerate action
- Independent `lib/application/authz.ts` → manual review
- Product `features/billing` → untouched

### Historical upgrade rehearsal findings

Materialized fixtures: `packages/cli/src/__tests__/fixtures/upgrade-rehearsal/historical/`

Test suite: `packages/cli/src/__tests__/upgrade-historical-rehearsal.test.ts`

| Field         | Value                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Target commit | `34400006d93f0e3d86de4f4e4cc5ec4b3cc62524` (v0.1 upgrade contract)                                                                                                            |
| Why chosen    | Predates the reference app split, UI foundation reset, template manifest, and baseline metadata — enough real infrastructure drift without being the immediately prior commit |

**Files rehearsed (manifest subset):**

| Path                              | Role in rehearsal                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/api/hooks.ts`            | Unmodified synced path; Atlas added `useTypedApiClient()` → **patch-safe replace**                             |
| `src/lib/api/config.ts`           | Unmodified synced path; documentation/comments evolved → **patch-safe replace**                                |
| `src/lib/auth/useSession.ts`      | Consumer customized session hook docs/behavior; Atlas added `principalId` / `permissions` → **merge-required** |
| `src/lib/api/contracts/schema.ts` | Generated artifact; OpenAPI **unchanged** between snapshots → **skip** (no regen)                              |
| `src/lib/application/authz.ts`    | Independent wiring introduced after source baseline → **manual review**                                        |
| `src/features/billing/index.tsx`  | Product-owned feature added by consumer → **never in plan**                                                    |

**What the historical rehearsal taught (beyond the synthetic fixture):**

1. **Real file size and import graphs matter** — rehearsing on actual `hooks.ts` / `useSession.ts`
   surfaces merge complexity that miniature strings hide (client hook composition, session state
   shape).
2. **New independent paths need explicit planner handling** — `lib/application/authz.ts` did not
   exist at the source snapshot; the planner now emits manual review when Atlas introduces
   independent wiring rather than silently skipping.
3. **OpenAPI stability is not guaranteed every release** — this window had no spec drift, so
   regenerate actions did not fire; `atlas upgrade` must still treat spec changes as the primary
   regen trigger.
4. **Fail-closed baseline is essential on real trees** — a partial baseline on a 100+ path manifest
   would have looked “valid” while permitting unsafe replaces; completeness validation and
   missing-checksum `unknown` status are required in production tooling.
5. **Security classification remains heuristic in the upgrade contract** — `session.ts` security
   relevance is still path-substring based in the internal planner; canonical classification belongs
   to advisory metadata (`atlas upgrade` should not hardcode path lists as policy).

**Manual work still required in this upgrade window:**

- Merge Atlas `useSession` permission/principal fields with consumer billing-portal session
  customization.
- Review newly introduced `lib/application/authz.ts` wiring pattern before adopting Atlas
  composition changes.
- Run full validation (`atlas doctor`, `pnpm api:check`, `pnpm template:check`, tests) after any
  manual merges.

**Implications for `atlas upgrade`:**

- Planner must treat **new independent paths** as manual-review items.
- Release snapshots must include **source-era content** for paths added after consumer baseline (not
  only current manifest paths).
- Baseline capture must remain **strict** on canonical checkouts; incomplete baselines must block
  automated replace paths.
- Do not assume every upgrade triggers OpenAPI regeneration — gate regen on spec diff.

## Supported upgrade promise (1.0)

The first npm-distributed Atlas CLI (`@blitzcraftlabs/atlas@1.0.1`, published from canonical
`v1.0.1`) supports:

| Promise               | Detail                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **We support**        | Adjacent upgrades between the current Atlas release and the immediately previous supported production release |
| **We support**        | Deterministic conflict detection for synced template infrastructure                                           |
| **We support**        | Regeneration for generated artifacts                                                                          |
| **We do not support** | Unlimited historical upgrades, including rehearsal snapshots `0.1.0` / `0.2.0`                                |
| **We do not support** | Silent overwrite of consumer-modified synced files                                                            |
| **We do not support** | Perpetual automatic upgrades with zero review                                                                 |
| Pre-1.0 proving line  | Breaking changes were allowed with changelog + migration docs; they are historical                            |
| 1.0 public contract   | Breaking public CLI/project/upgrade/distribution contracts require a major version                            |
| Migration retention   | Best-effort; at least one minor release deprecation notice when practicable                                   |

Release evidence is **package-owned**. `atlas upgrade --to <version>` loads snapshots from the
installed `@blitzcraftlabs/atlas` package catalog. `--releases-dir` is an explicit
fixture/maintainer override. Generated consumers do not carry an Atlas `releases/` tree. Missing or
corrupt packaged evidence fails closed.

The canonical `v0.5.0` tag is the previous production baseline for the first public npm CLI. GitHub
`v1.0.0` is the first stable platform release. The first npm registry version is `1.0.1`. Do not
publish `0.5.0` or `1.0.0` to npm, and do not retag `v1.0.0`.

## `atlas upgrade` requirements checklist

Discovered during upgrade rehearsal — `atlas upgrade` implements:

- [x] `atlas upgrade` command with `--dry-run` and `--json`
- [x] Detect consumer modifications via `platform.baseline.syncedPathChecksums` before overwrite
- [x] Fail closed when baseline checksum evidence is missing or incomplete (never treat absence as
      safe)
- [x] Preserve consumer-owned and independent paths
- [x] Emit manual review when Atlas introduces new independent wiring paths absent from source
      snapshot
- [x] Regenerate generated surfaces (`pnpm api:gen`) when generator inputs changed — not on every
      upgrade
- [x] Represent conflicts explicitly (`merge-required` items)
- [x] Support stepping through migration chain for non-adjacent versions
- [x] Refresh `platform.baseline` after successful upgrade
- [x] Load release snapshot artifacts for planning (source + target era content)
- [x] Package upgrade planning for workspace `@atlas/*` versions
- [x] Security-critical metadata support via planner categories (canonical advisories remain in
      [security.md](security.md))
- [x] Final validation hook (`atlas doctor`) in upgrade workflow
- [x] Contract schema migrations flagged as `migration-required` (automatic chain when registered)
- [x] Executable migrations with registered IDs (production registry; fixture evidence in CLI tests)
- [x] Source-release baseline validation (target-only path additions do not invalidate baseline)
- [x] Explicit synced-path transitions (new / removed / ownership change)
- [x] Advance root `package.json` version with `platform.baseline.atlasVersion` on success
- [x] Machine-readable upgrade plan output for agents/CI

Registered production migrations are documented under `docs/migrations/`. When no structural
migration is required for a release pair, the production registry remains empty and template sync
handles the upgrade.

**Partial / deferred within `atlas upgrade`:**

- Full three-way merge engine (merge-required + conflict context only)
- Cross-published-version clean-room proof (`0.4.0 → 0.5.0`) remains deferred only while the
  packaged catalog contains a single production version. Once a second production snapshot exists,
  `pnpm distribution:verify` reconstructs previous-release Atlas-owned state from packaged snapshots
  and requires a planned, applied, and validated installed upgrade.

**Expert flag:** `--skip-validation` skips post-upgrade `atlas doctor` only. It never skips
migration completion checks, required package update checks, strict target baseline capture, or
release identity consistency. Use for fixture/CI isolation only.

**Release identity:** After a successful upgrade, root `package.json` `version` and
`platform.baseline.atlasVersion` advance together so Doctor's upgrade-baseline check stays coherent.

**Explicitly not `atlas upgrade`:** public advisory feed, npm publication.
