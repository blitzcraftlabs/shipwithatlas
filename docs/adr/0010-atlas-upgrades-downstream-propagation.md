# ADR-0010: Atlas Upgrades and Downstream Fix Propagation

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

Atlas is a **source-owned** frontend platform. Consumers fork the public monorepo, customize product
code, and often customize infrastructure wiring. Atlas continues to ship fixes to auth, API
infrastructure, security, UI packages, generators, and conventions.

ADR-0009 established **ownership classification** and **monorepo template sync** between `apps/web`
and `apps/reference`. It intentionally does not define how an external consumer six months behind
receives fixes without overwriting product work.

This ADR scopes the **upgrade contract**, conflict policy, baseline metadata, security propagation
model, downstream→upstream lifecycle, and a reproducible upgrade rehearsal. Executable migration
tooling belongs to `atlas upgrade` — not here.

## Decision

### 1. Upgrade follows semantic ownership (ADR-0007 / ADR-0009)

Every Atlas surface has a deliberate upgrade channel derived from ownership — not from incidental
byte equality today.

| Ownership channel             | Examples                                        | Upgrade mechanism (v0.1)                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Versioned package             | `@atlas/ui`, `@atlas/consent`, `@atlas/config`  | Monorepo/workspace version bump + changelog     |
| Generated artifact            | OpenAPI `schema.ts`                             | `pnpm api:gen` / `pnpm api:check`               |
| Atlas-managed template        | Manifest `syncedPaths` under `apps/web`         | Selective replace when baseline checksums match |
| Consumer-owned source         | Product features, routes, shell composition     | Never overwrite automatically                   |
| Application-owned wiring      | Manifest `independentPaths`                     | Manual review; divergence allowed               |
| Structural contract           | `atlas.config.json`, ESLint architecture policy | Doctor + migration guides (`atlas upgrade`)     |
| Migration-managed             | Breaking directory/generator output changes     | Documented migration chain (`atlas upgrade`)    |
| Documentation / procedure     | Conventions, ADRs                               | Upgrade guide only                              |
| Reference-only / starter-only | `apps/reference`, `/examples`                   | Optional; out of consumer upgrade scope         |

### 2. Record an Atlas platform baseline at bootstrap

`atlas.config.json` gains an optional `platform.baseline` object (contract schema v1 extension):

| Field                           | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atlasVersion`                  | Atlas repository snapshot SemVer at last recorded baseline      |
| `contractSchemaVersion`         | `atlas.config.json` schema version at baseline                  |
| `templateManifestSchemaVersion` | `templates/app-infrastructure.manifest.json` schema at baseline |
| `syncedPathChecksums`           | SHA-256 of each manifest `syncedPaths` file at baseline         |

`atlas init` records this metadata on first initialization when the infrastructure manifest is
present. When the manifest exists, baseline capture is strict — init fails rather than recording
incomplete evidence. `atlas upgrade` will refresh it after successful upgrades.

**Version concepts (minimal):**

| Concept                          | Source                                  | Used for                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Atlas release version            | Root `package.json` / git tag           | Primary consumer baseline identity    |
| Contract schema version          | `atlas.config.json` `schemaVersion`     | Contract migrations (`atlas upgrade`) |
| Template manifest schema version | Manifest `schemaVersion`                | Sync policy migrations                |
| CLI snapshot version             | `@blitzcraftlabs/atlas` package version | Doctor tooling drift warnings         |

We do **not** introduce independent per-file or per-package baseline version numbers in v0.1.

### 3. Detect consumer modifications with baseline checksums

**Chosen strategy:** baseline checksums for manifest `syncedPaths`, plus manifest `independentPaths`
for explicitly consumer-owned wiring.

At upgrade time for each synced path:

1. Compare consumer file checksum to **recorded baseline checksum**.
2. If baseline evidence is **missing or invalid** → **unknown** → manual review; never auto-replace.
3. If consumer file is **missing** → manual review; never auto-replace.
4. If baseline proves **modified** → **merge-required** (consumer modified); never auto-replace.
5. If baseline proves **unchanged** and Atlas target changed → **patch-safe replace** (or
   **security-critical** when path is security-relevant per advisory metadata).
6. If baseline proves unchanged and Atlas target unchanged → skip.

**Rejected alternatives:**

| Approach                    | Why rejected for v0.1                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Git ancestry / merge-base   | Cannot assume clean fork topology or preserved upstream history               |
| Byte-identical only         | Cannot distinguish consumer edits from Atlas edits                            |
| Full three-way merge engine | Correct long-term; belongs in `atlas upgrade` with release snapshot artifacts |
| Separate checksum file      | Duplicates contract ownership; baseline belongs in project contract           |

Release snapshot artifacts for true three-way merge are an `atlas upgrade` requirement, not an
upgrade-contract deliverable in this ADR.

### 4. Conflict policy

> **Consumer modifications win unless the operator explicitly merges Atlas changes.**

Atlas must **never silently overwrite** consumer modifications to synced template infrastructure.
Conflicts are **deterministic**, **machine-representable**, and surfaced before writes.

### 5. Upgrade change taxonomy (v0.1)

| Category             | Meaning                                        | Typical action                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `patch-safe`         | Low-risk; consumer copy still matches baseline | Replace / regenerate            |
| `merge-required`     | Atlas and consumer both changed same surface   | Manual review                   |
| `migration-required` | Contract/generator breaking change             | Run migration (`atlas upgrade`) |
| `manual`             | Application-owned or architectural choice      | Human decision                  |
| `security-critical`  | Security fix on untouched synced path          | Urgent patch-safe replace       |

### 6. Security propagation (local contract; advisories live in security engineering)

When Atlas ships a security fix in template-owned infrastructure:

1. **Identify affected versions** via release notes / future security advisories.
2. **Doctor** can compare `platform.baseline.atlasVersion` to patched release range.
3. **Untouched synced paths** receive urgent patch-safe replacement.
4. **Consumer-modified security paths** surface `merge-required` with security-critical severity —
   never silent overwrite.
5. Package-based fixes (`@atlas/ui`, etc.) follow workspace version bumps independently.

### 7. Downstream → upstream propagation

Client-discovered bugs in Atlas-owned infrastructure follow:

1. **Classify ownership** using architecture-ownership.md + manifest.
2. **Reproduce** in Atlas canonical starter (`apps/web`) or reference app when relevant.
3. **Fix canonical ownership** (package, synced path, generator, or docs).
4. **Add regression tests** in the owning package/app.
5. **Release** new Atlas snapshot; consumers upgrade via this contract.

Consumers do not become the source of truth — they contribute fixes through Atlas canonical paths.

### 8. Upgrade rehearsal (evidence for `atlas upgrade`)

`packages/cli/src/upgrade/` provides an **internal** planner and safe-apply helper (test-only, not a
public `atlas upgrade` command). Rehearsal evidence includes:

- **Synthetic fixture** (`upgrade-rehearsal.test.ts`) — algorithm-focused miniature files.
- **Historical fixture** (`upgrade-historical-rehearsal.test.ts`) — materialized files from Atlas
  `8ce8fa3` → upgrade-contract target with consumer billing/session customizations.

Historical rehearsal confirmed patch-safe replaces on real `hooks.ts` / `config.ts`, merge-required
on customized `useSession.ts`, manual review for newly introduced independent `authz.ts`, and no
OpenAPI regeneration when the spec was unchanged across the snapshot window.

### 9. Supported upgrade promise (v0.1 — conservative)

| Topic                         | v0.1 promise                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upgrade span                  | Documented migration chain for adjacent intentional releases when available    |
| Arbitrary historical upgrades | **Not promised** — may require stepping through migrations or manual work      |
| Automatic upgrades            | **Not promised** — only deterministic proposals + safe auto-apply in tests     |
| Migration retention           | While pre-1.0; at least one minor release notice before removal when practical |
| Unsupported baselines         | Doctor warns; Atlas reports manual upgrade required                            |

### 10. `atlas upgrade` boundary

This ADR defines **what** must be automated. `atlas upgrade` implements:

- `atlas upgrade` / `atlas migrate` commands
- release snapshot artifacts for three-way merge
- dry-run, JSON output, baseline refresh
- contract schema migrations

## Alternatives Considered

### Single `atlas migrate` command now

Rejected — duplicates `atlas upgrade` scope and risks shipping unsafe auto-overwrites before
conflict policy is proven.

### Store baseline only in git tags

Rejected — consumers may copy templates without preserving git topology; contract must be
self-describing.

### Promote all infrastructure to packages

Rejected in ADR-0009 — poor fit for forkable, editable source.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear, testable upgrade contract aligned with existing ownership model
- Conflict detection without requiring git history
- Evidence-backed requirements for `atlas upgrade`
- Security path defined without duplicating the advisory backend in
  [security.md](../how-we-build/security.md)

### Negative

- `platform.baseline.syncedPathChecksums` can be large — acceptable for machine metadata
- Baseline must be refreshed after upgrades (`atlas upgrade`)
- Full three-way merge still manual until `atlas upgrade` provides release snapshots
