/**
 * Breadcrumb System
 *
 * Tree-based breadcrumb system with resolver inheritance.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Tree-based route matching
 * - Static, i18n, and parameterized resolvers
 * - Async resolver support (for data fetching)
 * - Inheritance control (inherit: false to start fresh)
 * - Escape hatch (return null to skip a segment)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```ts
 * import { buildBreadcrumbs, breadcrumbTree } from "@/lib/breadcrumbs";
 *
 * const items = await buildBreadcrumbs({
 *   pathname: "/projects/123/settings",
 *   params: { projectId: "123" },
 *   searchParams: {},
 *   tree: breadcrumbTree,
 * });
 * ```
